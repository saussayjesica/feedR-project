# feedR-project

A personalized feed reader that pulls feeds from Digg, Reddit & Mashable. The user can filter between publications through the dropdown on the header menu. Clicking/tapping on one of the articles will load a pop up with more information. The user from that point will be able to either dismiss the additional information or go to the referenced article.
